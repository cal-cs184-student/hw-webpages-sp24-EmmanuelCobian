					<h3>How to rasterize triangles</h3>
					<p>The way I go about rasterizing triangles is by looping through the grid of pixels around the
						triangle I wish to draw and then checking to see if the center of a pixel is inside the triangle
						or not. The way to check if the center of a pixel is inside the triangle or not is by using the
						formula from lecture and performing the 3 line test for overlapping planes. If the point passes
						this test, then I fill the pixel in with a specified color.</p>
					<h3>Algorithm Efficiency</h3>
					<p>This algorithm to rasterize triangles is no worse than than one that checks each sample within
						the bounding box of the triangle because when looping through the grid, we take into account the
						min and max values (x, y) can take and only loop through those. In other words, I only look at
						the pixels that surround the triangle, not the entire grid.</p>

			<h1>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h1>
			<div class="row mt-4">
				<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
					<h3>Why is supersampling useful?</h3>
					<p>Supersampling is useful because it allows us to take multiple samples of a pixel and then average
						the color of those samples to get a more accurate color for the pixel. This is useful because it
						allows us to antialias the edges of the triangle and get a more accurate representation of the
						color of the triangle.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
					<h3>What modifications were made to the rasterization pipeline?</h3>
					<p>The modifications made to the rasterization pipeline were to add more loops that iterate through the grid of samples within a singular pixel. Then performing a line test for each of these samples. Then when it was time to resolve the sample buffer to the frame buffer, I take the average color value of each pixel and output that as the final color.</p>

				<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-4">
					<h3>How supersampling was used to antialias triangles</h3>
					<p>Supersampling was used to antialias triangles by taking multiple samples of the pixels and then
						averaging the color of those samples to get a more accurate color for the pixel. In other words,
						the image was rasterized at a higher resolution and then downsampled to the output resolution of
						the framebuffer.</p>

					<p>Barycentric coordinates are a set of three numbers that describe the position of a point with

			<h1>Task 5: "Pixel Sampling" For Texture Mapping</h1>
			<div class="row mt-4">
				<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6">
					<h3>What is Pixel Sampling?</h3>
					<p>Pixel sampling is the process of taking a sample of a pixel, translating that pixel position to a texture position, and then sampling that texture image to get the color of the pixel. This is useful because it gives us a standard way of mapping texture coordinates with pixel coordinates. Additionally, different modes of pixel sampling helps reduce aliasing by averaging neighboring texture color positions.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6">
					<h3>Nearest vs. Bilinear Sampling</h3>
					<p>Nearest sampling is the process of taking the color of the nearest texture color to the sample point. On the other hand,
						bilinear sampling is the process of taking the average of the colors of the 4 nearest texture positions to
						the sample point. Bilinear sampling is better than nearest sampling because it gives a more
						accurate color for the pixel.</p>

			<h1>Task 6: "Level Sampling" With Mipmaps For Texture Mapping</h1>
			<div class="row mt-4">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<h3>What is level sampling?</h3>
					<p>Level sampling is the process of taking 1 or more samples of a texture color from a mipmap and then averaging the color(s)
						of those sample(s) to get a more accurate color for the pixel. Level sampling is useful because it helps create a smooth transition between textures depending on their relative distance to the viewer. It's also good for optimization because mipmaps are precomputed ahead of time and stored in memory.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<h3>How was level sampling used?</h3>
					<p>I used level sampling to implement both nearest and bilinear mipmap levels. With nearest, I just take the mipmap level that's closest to the sample given the process of calculating L, from lecture. On the other hand, bilinear mipmap levels interpolate between the two nearest levels with L as the weight dictating how much to take from each color. </p>
